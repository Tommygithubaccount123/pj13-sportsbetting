## Jonathan Zhang

Hello, my name is Jonathan Zhang, and I am a Computer Science and Statistics and Data Science student at UCSB.

### Project Ideas:
1. **AI-Powered Team Collaboration Tool**: Develop an app with AI-integrated features like meeting summaries, deadline tracking, and task prioritization, using React for the frontend and Flask or Django for the backend.
2. **Smart Resource Optimizer**: Create a platform that uses AI to allocate team resources dynamically, factoring in time constraints, deadlines, and availability, with a sleek dashboard built in React and a scalable backend in Node.js.
3. **AI-Driven Learning Platform**: Build a platform that uses natural language processing to customize study plans and recommend learning resources, integrating GPT models on the backend with a React frontend for interactivity.
